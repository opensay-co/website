## Introductions
Name, How long you have been in colorado, current emotions, etc

## Land Recognition
*We acknowledges, with respect, that the land we are on today is the traditional and ancestral homelands of the Arapaho, Cheyenne, and Ute Nations and peoples. This was also a site of trade, gathering, and healing for numerous other Native tribes. We recognize the Indigenous peoples as original stewards of this land and all the relatives within it. As these words of acknowledgment are spoken and heard, the ties Nations have to their traditional homelands are renewed and reaffirmed.*

# Agenda Items

0. Suggest and comment on any agenda items we want to add not in the list below

1. Try to come up with broad areas able to be targeted through legislative action/ballot intatives, add as many items to this list as possible:
    a. Decarbonizing Electricity
    b. Housing Standards
    c. Vehicle Electrification

2. Find the research neccessary to continue on each one of those areas, and try to get people to bring it to the next meeting.

3. Figure out how we are going to get the word out for actions like these, it isnt an open process if no one knows about it or knows they can join up.
