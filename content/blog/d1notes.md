We are actual  e people not corporations
Living in Colorado
People who live here
Not out of state, Wall Street traded firms
We have a right a right to plan our future
We recognize our responsibilty as Coloradans to the other people on the planet. We also have a responsibility to lead the renewable energy transformation.  We recognize that Colorado has played a leadership role in promoting renewable energy and we intend to carry on that tradition.  

Name, what organizations they are a part of.
12:21 they tried to kick us out, said we couldn't meet here and to move along.
Members of communities
Civil society is composed of organizations.  It's more than just a collection of individuals.  We don't want to devalue people who aren't part of organizations. You and they do not matter less to us.  Some people just moved to Colorado yesterday.  Not evereyone is a formal citizen.  If you live here you deserve to have a voice.  
People deserve to make and plan their energy future not just go along with or sign off on what a corporation or elected officials have made
We're members of the economic system.  We're members of the political system.  We're also members of civil society.  There is civic power.  We're here representing all aspects, as producers and consumers in the economy, as citizens or residents of a state, as members of communities, as US citizens with particular responsibilities,
As people who haved the power to fix the climate crisis
As people who are affected by the climate crisis
We're here because we have the responsibility to speak (not just the right to be here).
What we are doing is essentially political, exercising our rights and responsibilities as citizens.

This is a planning meeting
It's also a vigil
There are a lot of planning meetings occurring as we speak. At Xcel, at the capitol, at E3 consultikng at the CO energy office, at the state legislature and these are not open.  This meeting will be occurring out in the open.
We need to hold these entities accountable.  We need to be awake and watching.  We spent the last 40 years waiting for those in formal positions, for the supposed grown ups in the room, to take this seriously. 
And the opportunity of clean energy isn't being realized as it could.
'The priority that we see seems largely to be to preserve corporate profits of the very largest firms. 
We believe the governor and the legislature understand Xcel is a problem but they don't dare speak up.  They may be afraid of the economic power that Xcel.
Can you imagine the Federeal Reserve lobbying for a particular political candidate?
Xcel is not that subtle..
Xcel runs and funds political campaigns against those who cross them.
The concentrated power in this building then runs and is being used against the citizens it is supposed to serve, and our politial leaders don't have the freedom to tell the truth abouut Xcel.
